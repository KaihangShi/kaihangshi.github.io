In a follow-up to our [original work on kidney stone growth modification](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19062), we have just had an article accepted in the ACS journal Crystal Growth and Design.

[This work](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.cgd.8b00945) focuses on further understanding the crystal growth modification of calcium oxalate crytals by examining additional growth modifiers. Using DFT we reveal that directionally-imposed strain by a modifier on a calcium oxalate crystal surface helps explain why some modifiers can cause crystal surfaces to shrink.

Many thanks to the [Rimer group](http://rimergroup.com/) at the University of Houston for a productive collaboration!
