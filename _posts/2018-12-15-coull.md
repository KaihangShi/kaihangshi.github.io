I am very happy to have been selected as this year's Dr. James M. Coull Fellowship award winner from the Department of Chemcial and Petroleum Engineering here at the University of Pittsburgh! Congrats to all awardees and my fellow cohort at Pitt for the fantastic last few years. Especially thanks to my wonderful advisor Dr. Giannis Mpourmpakis for his help and guidance toward being competetive for this award. I couldn't have done it without you!
