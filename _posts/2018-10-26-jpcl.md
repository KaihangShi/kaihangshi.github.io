Continuing the success of our [thermodynamic stability model](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15988), we have just had an article accepted in the Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters!

[This work](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b02679) compares experimental results for heterometal dopant locations and concentrations with the Au<sub>25</sub>(S-PET)<sub>18</sub> metal nanocluster. We find a remarkable agreement with experiments for the thermodynamic stability model, rationalizng more experimetnal observations than previous work into doping within this cluster.
