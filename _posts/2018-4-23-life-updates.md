With the students of Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics (CHE 200) taking their final exam I am closing the book on another semester finished of TAing. I really enjoyed giving a lecture to the class this year on Excess Properties along with forming some close relationships with some of the students! I wish all the students the very best in their future classes and careers!

Additionally, the annual swanson school of engineering undergraduate research publication [Ingenium](http://www.engineering.pitt.edu/Research/Office-Of-Research/_Documents/2018-Ingenium-Journal-Swanson-School-of-Engineering/) was just released. I was happy to serve on the editorial board again this year and would like to congratulate all the undegraduate authors on their great work.
