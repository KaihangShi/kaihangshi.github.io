## 2020
**December** 
- I was invited to give a talk on the uniqueness of the microscopic pressure tensor at the [Statistical Mechanics & Molecular Simulations (STMS) Seminar Series](https://lu.ma/qyzdeu6p), hosted by Prof. Amir Haji-Akbari (Yale) and Prof. Sapna Sarupria (Clemson).

**Nov. 30**, I was invited to give a 110-minute guest lecture in the course *Molecular Simulation of Materials* in Civil and Environmental Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University.

**Nov. 19**, The paper in collaboration with Prof. Carlos Vega's group has been published in *Journal of Chemical Physics*. The title is "The Young–Laplace equation for a solid–liquid interface".

**Nov. 17**, I gave a pre-recorded talk at the 2020 AIChE Annual Meeting and I had great time meeting old and new friends there virtually!


**August**, I joined Prof. Randy Snurr's group at Northwestern University as a postdoc fellow!

**July 27**, My first-author paper has been published in *J. Chem. Theory Comput.*. The title is "Microscopic Pressure Tensor in Cylindrical Geometry: Pressure of Water in a Carbon Nanotube".

**May 18**, I successfully defended my PhD thesis! 

**Apr. 27**, Our Reply to the Comment on the microscopic pressure tensor has been published in *Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics*. 

**

**Jan. 24**, The paper in collaboration with Prof. Gregory Parsons's group has been published in *Journal of Materials Chemistry A*. The title is "Fabrication of a freestanding metal organic framework predominant hollow fiber mat and its potential applications in gas separation and catalysis".
