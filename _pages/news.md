## 2020
**December** 
- I was invited to give a talk on the uniqueness of the microscopic pressure tensor at the [Statistical Mechanics & Molecular Simulations (STMS) Seminar Series](https://lu.ma/qyzdeu6p), hosted by Prof. Amir Haji-Akbari (Yale) and Prof. Sapna Sarupria (Minnesota).

**November**
- I was invited to give a 110-minute guest lecture in the course *Molecular Simulation of Materials* in Civil and Environmental Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University.
- The paper in collaboration with Prof. Carlos Vega's group has been published in *Journal of Chemical Physics*. The title is "The Young–Laplace equation for a solid–liquid interface".
- I gave a pre-recorded talk at the 2020 AIChE Annual Meeting and I had a great time meeting some friends there virtually!

**October**
- I gave a virtual poster on MOFdb at the 2020 Nanoporous Materials Genome Center (NMGC) All-Hands Meeting.  

**August**
- I joined Prof. Randy Snurr's group at Northwestern University as a postdoc fellow!

**July**
- My first-author paper has been published in *J. Chem. Theory Comput.*. The title is "Microscopic Pressure Tensor in Cylindrical Geometry: Pressure of Water in a Carbon Nanotube".

**May**
- I successfully defended my PhD thesis! 
- The paper in collaboration with Prof. Saad Khan's group has been published in *ACS Appl. Polym. Mater.*. The title is "Designing Intrinsically Microporous Polymer (PIM-1) Microfibers with Tunable Morphology and Porosity via Controlling Solvent/Nonsolvent/Polymer Interactions".

**April**
- Our Reply to the Comment on the microscopic pressure tensor has been published in *Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics*. 

**March**
