**Description:** Our [work](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b02679) on heterometal doping in atomically-precise ligand-protectect nanoclusters  was highlighted as both a [cover](https://pubs.acs.org/toc/jpclcd/9/23) and [spotlight](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b03570) in JPCL. Very excited to have the work highlighted!

**Description:** I made and designed this cover for the [work](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b03459) of my collegue, Natalie Austin, highlighting the imposed 3D-nature of gold sub-nanometer catalysts by the presence of adsorbates.
