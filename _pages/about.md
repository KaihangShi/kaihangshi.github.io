I am a postdoctoral fellow in Prof. Randy Snurr's group at Northwestern University. I obtained my PhD in Chemical Engineering (2020) under guidance of Prof. Keith Gubbins (co-advised by Prof. Erik Santiso) at North Carolina State University. Before I came to NC State, I recieved my BS in Polymer Science and Engineering (2015) from East China University of Science & Technology, Shanghai, China.

My research interests are applying molecular simulation, theory and machine learning to understand the phase equilibria, transport and chemical reactions of complex fluids at interfaces, surfaces and in confined systems, and developing theoretical tools for engineering purposes to predict the thermodynamic and structural properties that are usually inaccesible or difficult to measure by the state-of-the-art experiments.  

In my spare time, I love traveling around the world, swimming and playing video games (Metroidvania especially)...
