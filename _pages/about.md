I am a fifth-year PhD student in [Prof. Keith Gubbins' group](https://www.cbe.ncsu.edu/people/keg/) (co-advisor Prof. Erik Santiso) at North Carolina State University (NCSU). Before I came to NC State, I recieved my BS in Polymer Science and Engineering in 2015 from East China University of Science & Technology (ECUST), Shanghai, China.

My research interests are applying molecular simulation and theory to understand the phase equilibria, transport and chemical reactions of complex fluids at interfaces, surfaces and in confined systems, and developing theoretical tools for engineering purposes to predict the thermodynamic and structural properties that are usually inaccesible or difficult to measure by the state-of-the-art experiments.  

In my spare time, I love traveling around the world, playing saxophone and video games...
