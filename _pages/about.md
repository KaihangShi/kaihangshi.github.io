I am a fifth-year PhD student in [Keith Gubbins' group](https://www.cbe.ncsu.edu/people/keg/) at North Carolina State University (NCSU). Before I came to the NC State, I recieved my BS in Polymer Science and Engineering from the East China University of Science & Technology (ECUST), Shanghai, China.

My research interests are applying molecular simulation and theory to understand the phase equilibria, transport and chemical reactions of complex fluids at interfaces, surfaces and in confined systems, and developing advanced tools for engineering purposes to predict the thermodynamics of inhomogeneous fluids and characterize porous materials by combining experiments and statistical mechanics. 

In my spare time, I love traveling around the world, playing saxophone and playing video games...
