Current Research Thrusts
### Atomically-Precise Nanoclusters
I apply [Density Functional Theory](http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/dft-book/dft.pdf) towards understanding and predicting the stability, stoichiometry, and morphology of atomically-precise thiolated metal nanoclusters. We are also working with our [thermodynamic stability theory](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15988) towards prediction of targeted doping and alloying within these frameworks.

### Nanoalloy Energetics
Utilizing our [recently developed model](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b00670) based largely on [early metal energetics theory](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.28.665) we are working on rapid computational screening of the stability of nanoalloys. The goal of this work is to be able engineer new nanoalloys for targeted applications.

### Understanding metal nanoparticle morphology, stability, and properties using accelerated models
Moving past the formulation of [older theory](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.28.665) we are working collaboratively with the [Gounaris group](https://www.cmu.edu/cheme/people/faculty/chrysanthos-e-gounaris.html) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) to design and optimize new formulations for nanoparticle stability. Our first work modeling [catalytic activity trends](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acscatal.5b01696) with nanoparticle morphology was published in 2015.

### Kidney Stone Growth Inhibition
I am working on methods to understand and rationalize inhibition of kidney stone growth by a number of modifiers. Our [work](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19062) was published in **Nature** and a follow-up work highlighting other modifiers should be published soon!
