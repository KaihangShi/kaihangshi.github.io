## Projects
### Atomically-Precise Nanoclusters
I apply [Density Functional Theory](http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/dft-book/dft.pdf) towards understanding and predicting the stability, stoichiometry, and morphology of atomically-precise thiolated metal nanoclusters. I am working towards prediction of targeted doping and alloying within these frameworks to engineering new potential structures.
