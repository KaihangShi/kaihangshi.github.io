## Pressure Enhancement in Adsorbed Films for Future High-Pressure Processing
I applied molecular simulations and statistical mechanics to understand the physics behind strong compression and the induced high pressure (as high as tens of thousands of bars) in adsorbed layers. Such in-layer high pressures could explain chemical reactions that normally require a high bulk pressure and the formation of solid phases in confined nanopores. These discoveries would also lead to [a ‘green’ route to the future high-pressure manufacturing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095809917308354), such as performing efficient high-pressure chemical reactions in a carbon nanotube without the need for expansive and dangerous mechanical compression. We found that, in many cases, it is the tangential pressure in the direction parallel to the surface that is the main driving force for high pressure phenomena in pores. However, it is still challenging to measure and predict the tangential pressure both experimentally and theoretically. We are developing a new experimental route to estimate the effective tangential pressure by combining standard experimental adsorption data with [a 2D equation of state](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5029488) derived from statistical mechanics. In the near future, we expect to apply our predictive tool to design a complex chemical reaction or separation process that require a careful control of the microscopic pressure. 





## Adsorption on Heterogeneous Surfaces
Molecular simulations and theoretical analyses of thin films adsorbed onto solid surfaces or within narrow pores have usually treated the solid surfaces as atomically smooth and energetically homogeneous. Most surfaces, however, exhibit roughness through geometric curvature, variations of surface composition and chemical groups attached to the surfaces. Such oversimplification of the surfaces thus misses important features of adsorption. We've developed a conformal sites theory for a solid substrate whose surface is both geometrically and energetically heterogeneous, and that interacts with an adsorbed film. The theory is based on a perturbation expansion for the grand potential for the real heterogeneous surface about that for an ideal reference surface, thus mapping the real system onto a much simpler interfacial system. One of the extensions of this theory is to develop [a coarse-grained solid-fluid potential](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b00440) for an energetically heterogeneous surface. Due to the flexibility of this theory, we are exploring the possibilities of incorporating this theory into the software of the experimental instruments to predict the adsorption properties and to characterize the solid substrate.
