Description: Nanoclusters (very small metal nanoparticles) represent an exciting newer class of nanoparticles that are being used in applications from drug delivery to catalysis. Towards developing a better understanding of their stability we have developed a [new theory](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15988). In this video we explain this new theory and describe its significance.
