## Web Content

**Description:** Nanoclusters (very small metal nanoparticles) represent an exciting newer class of nanoparticles that are being used in applications from drug delivery to catalysis. Towards developing a better understanding of their stability we have developed a [new theory](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15988). In this video we explain this new theory and describe its significance.

**Description:** I made and designed this cover for the [work](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b03459) of my collegue, Natalie Austin, highlighting the imposed 3D-nature of gold sub-nanometer catalysts by the presence of adsorbates.
